# 🧩 Sudoku Solver CodeAlpha C++ Internship TASK 3

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Sudoku Solver** is a C++ program that efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels using backtracking. Additionally, a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** can be implemented for better user interaction.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ **Solve Sudoku Puzzles** – Automatically solves any valid Sudoku puzzle.
- ✅ **Backtracking Algorithm** – Uses recursion for efficient solving.
- ✅ **Handles Different Difficulty Levels** – Works for easy to expert puzzles.
- ✅ **GUI Support (Optional)** – Allows users to interact visually with the solver.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Concepts Used:** Backtracking Algorithm, Recursion, File Handling
- **GUI (Optional):** SFML / Qt for graphical representation
